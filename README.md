# DEG study and algorithm comparison

Simulate synthetic parallel Microarray and RNA-Seq datasets and evaluate DEG algorithms' performance on it.
Included algorithms are T-test, SAM, Ebayes, DESeq,baySeq and SAMseq.

simualtion.r performs simulation and generate DEG table for each method.

analysis method.r summarizes the pairwise comparison based on output DEG table

generate.r contains function required in generating synthetic dataset.

'method'.r performs DEG analysis on given dataset.
